# Past releases

As a tribute to history, this wiki has seen many historical releases and rewrites. To keep track of the past, for these historical reasons and in case someone needs an older tutorial that is no longer available on the main wiki page, we'll keep track of those releases the we remove from the "Releases" tab on the repository.

This page and these releases won't be shown on the wiki itself, but will be accessible through this repository and will not be deleted throughout the course of the wiki.

The following release tags have been archived here and can be downloaded at any time.
