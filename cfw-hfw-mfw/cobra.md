# Cobra

The term "Cobra" originally referred to the payload originally found in Cobra USB, a USB modchip that added features to CFW consoles. Team Cobra has since moved on to open source their payload, and is now included in most modern CFWs. Cobra features include:

* Region free Blu-Ray
* ISO mounting for Blu-Ray/DVD/PS1/PS2/PS3\*
* Mounting ISOs and games over network
* ISOs can be split and still mounted, to bypass FAT32 4GB file limit on USB
* PS1 backup discs work just like retail discs
* Launch any PSP ISO using the [Cobra PSP Launcher](http://store.brewology.com/ahomebrew.php?brewid=247) \(compatibility is not 100%\)\*
* Launch PS2 ISOs on _any_ console \(HDD only, software emulator is not 100% compatible\)
* Never requires a real disc in drive
* Boot Plugins \(apps that run in the background on boot\)
* Dynamic firmware spoofing for mounted backups \(apps don't require updates for every firmware update\)

\*PS1 games must be converted to .BIN in all cases. Also, Cobra ODE cannot mount PSP ISOs, but can play them if converted to PKG form.

**Note that Cobra is an alternative to** [**Mamba**](mamba.md)**, and therefore incompatible**
