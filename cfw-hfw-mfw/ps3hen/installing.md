# Installing

## Installing

### What we will need for this procedure is a USB drive and a PC/Laptop or any way to transfer over files to the USB.

1. **Download the** [**4.87.1 HFW**](https://www.psx-place.com/threads/4-87-1-hfw-hybrid-firmware.31958/) from Joonie on the PSX-Place Forums.
2. By now you should have a .zip file, **extract it by using an unarchiver of your choice**.
3. **Take your USB and make sure you format it to FAT32** \(formatting will erase all of your files on it\).Here is an easy to follow [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5-yogh6m4M) on how to.
4. **Create a folder called PS3 and another folder called UPDATE** inside it by right clicking and choosing New Folder. Make sure you enter the folder names **EXACTLY** as I typed it.
5. Now **move the HFW\_4.87.1\_PS3UPDAT.PUP inside the UPDATE folder and rename it to PS3UPDAT.PUP** by right clicking it and choosing Rename.
6. Now **safely take out the USB or eject it and insert it on the PS3 \(right-most port\)**.
7. On the PS3, enter **Safe Mode** and do the following:
   * **Turn the system off**.
   * Press the power button, but **keep holding**, even past the first beep.
   * **Continue to hold as the system beeps** again.
   * **Let go when the system double-beeps** and shuts off.
   * Now, **repeat the above steps.**
   * Once you're in Safe Mode, **connect a controller with a USB and choose option 6.**
   * **Update the firmware on your PS3** to 4.87.1 HFW on your USB.
8. It is recommended to do this **twice** as the firmware might not let you exploit on the first try.
9. After your PS3 finishes the update and once on the XMB go to your **PS3 Web Browser and press Triangle, then choose the Tools option and go down to Delete Cookies, from there go ahead and Delete Cookies/Search History/Cache and Authentication Information** then exit out from the browser.
10. **Re-open the browser press Start on the controller and then type in** [**ps3xploit.com**](https://ps3xploit.com/)**.**
11. **Once you're on the** [**ps3xploit.com**](https://ps3xploit.com/) **website move the cursor to the top left corner and hover over the PS3HEN option.** In the drop down Menu choose from the HEN Installer/Enabler or the HEN Enabler \(Alternate\). **I personally recommend** the HEN Enabler \(Alternate\) Since it's easier to use.
12. **After going through the HEN Installer**, go into the Network &gt; Remote Play option and quickly start spamming Circle to exit. **Now you should see an Install HEN** option above Remote Play, press X on it and wait for the installation to finish and then reboot the PS3.
13. After rebooting, **enable HEN and you're set to play** backups and install homebrew. HEN requires that you **enable it every time you restart**, so make sure you do that to play backups or use homebrew.
