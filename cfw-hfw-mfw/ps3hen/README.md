# PS3HEN

## For some 25xx, all 3xxx, and newer models, PS3HEN is where to look if you want homebrew on your console.

PS3HEN isn't a full jailbreak, because you won't have access to a certain part of the system required to have a full-blown CFW, which means you cannot do the following to your console with HEN:

* Use Linux
* Use Console Control API
* Use Factory Service Mode
* Convert from CEX to DEX
* Dump EID root key
* Read HDD on PC 
* Running non-encrypted PS2 ISOs
* Use IDPSet
* Use all features of reActPSN
  * activating games works
  * testing is being done to gather a list of what can/can't be done
* Use all features of PSNpatch
  * testing is being done to gather a list of what can/can't be done
* Use SEN Enabler
* Use Toolboxes from other CFWs

Understanding what your console can or can't do **could be the difference between working and broken**. Ensure that what you want to do is within the limits of HEN, and know that you cannot dive into the deep internals of the system.

However, HEN is Cobra compatible, and thus supports a wide variety of homebrew. Make sure that the homebrew is **resigned for HEN** \(chances are that the homebrew is\).
