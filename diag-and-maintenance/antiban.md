# Anti-ban EBOOTs

## Antiban EBOOTs

Some games, such as Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto, have a function in them that will scan your hard drive for homebrew files and report you to Sony if any are found. For this reason, if you play online with CFW, you will need to find an antiban EBOOT for the game and replace the original EBOOT in the game's files.

Antiban EBOOTs can generally be found online by searching " antiban EBOOT" on Google.

**You must have an antiban EBOOT that matches the region and version of your game**.

**If you update the game or install DLC, you will need a new antiban EBOOT**.

## Applying an Antiban EBOOT

1. Open an [FTP session](../big-stinky-brew/pc-tools/ftp-client.md) and navigate to the game's USRDIR directory. If it is a PSN game, it will be under `/dev_hdd0/game/<gamename>/USRDIR`, and if it is a disc-based game you will need to [rip the game to your hard drive](antiban.md) so that you can edit files and then navigate to the USRDIR folder in the directory which you placed the game.
2. Copy the EBOOT.bin file from your PS3 to your PC to keep as a backup; make sure not to overwrite your antiban EBOOT.
3. Copy the antiban EBOOT.bin file from your PC to your PS3, and overwrite the old one. Make sure that is named `EBOOT.bin`, otherwise rename it. If the game does not start up properly, you may have an EBOOT for a different region or version of the game.
