# All-In-One

All in ones provide many features, such as backup creation, file management, game launching, and system tweaks, all with only one application. The main two are **multiMAN** and **webMAN MOD**, both offering different styles of interacting but essentially being the same (although each has its own quirks).

**Having at least one all-in-one is highly recommended for all of the users with homebrew on their system,** especially if you're planning on doing more than just running backups and want to begin modifications (although I still recommend a file manager for the modding itself), set fan speeds, or do other tweaks but don't want to have to wade though a billion apps and games to find the one that's needed for your task (especially if you have a lot of games installed through PSN, that can get tiring.)

I recommend **webMAN MOD** because it's a beast on my system. It's fully integrated with its own web server, and making it accessible from my phone to load backups when I'm making a sandwich so I can sit down and game. Take a look at it on the webMAN MOD page, or go find the AIO that you like!
