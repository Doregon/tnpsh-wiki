# Firmware Flashers

Before installing CFW with USBs was available, people with phat and 2xxx consoles (minimum version of 3.55 or lower) used **firmware flashers** to manually downgrade their console by connecting to the NAND/NOR chip and sending a playload through the flasher.

Because this method has been replaced by USB installers for CFW and because of the potential risk if the steps are followed to initiate the process of this method, we're not copying the firmware flasher guides to this wiki. However, the r/ps3homebrew subreddit wiki still contains these methods and you can explore there if you so require.
