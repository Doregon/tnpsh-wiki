# Wiki Versioning

## Wiki Versioning

The wiki has a versioning system, to show when and where exactly it is in the timeline of the PlayStation 3's history. It's not too hard to figure out, but here it is anyway:

## Let's take version v21.1b4 and break it down.

In this version, **21** indicates the **current year.** This helps in the case of archiving where you can jump back to a specific time period by using the year as the base. Obviously, when a new year hits, this number rises by 1.

The **1** indicates the current **major revision**, which is where the wiki is. It will increment with huge changes, such as when the wiki is reorganized greatly or the "At This Instant!" section gets a new member.

The letter can follow one of these paths:

If it's a **b**, then it's a release on the "bleeding" branch with the most up-to-date but not complete information available. The information on the bleeding branch won't show on the wiki itself until the bleeding branch is merged with the master one. This is explained more in depth below.

If it's an **r**, then it's a minor revision release. This accompanies small updates to pages, information, and merges with the bleeding branch that aren't huge and wiki-changing.

## The Bleeding branch

As stated, the bleeding branch has the most up-to-date content but is considered bleeding because of how it might not contain the cleanest or complete products. This branch will not be the base of the wiki, and you must click the "Master" heading above the items in the sidebar to switch to it.
