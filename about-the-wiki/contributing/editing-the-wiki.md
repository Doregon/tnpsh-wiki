# Editing the Wiki

## You're here to make some changes, huh?

Well then, let's get you started. Here's what you'll need in order to successfully make edits to the wiki:

* A [GitHub](https://github.com) account
* Knowledge of the [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) format

### **Editing**

**If you haven't already**, sign up for GitHub by going to the link above and hitting Sign Up at the top-right of the screen \(or the menu on smaller devices and mobile\), and then navigate to my [Wiki repo](https://github.com/Doregon/tnpsh-wiki). You'll see all of the lovely little files that make up this wiki &lt;3

At the top right, select **Fork**. If you use GitHub and are in an organization, select your name rather than the organization's.

Once that's complete, you're all set to start editing! Head over to the page you wish to edit and **click the pencil icon** on the row next to Raw \| Blame. **Before you start editing, however,** make sure you read the [Contribution Guidelines](contribution-guidelines.md) page.

This will switch to **Editor Mode**, and then you'll be put at a monospaced screen with lots of syntax for lots of things. Go to the [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) syntax page to learn what it all means.

### Submitting

If you're ready to submit your changes to the main repo and the wiki, return to the main repository page and check out the bar in the middle of the screen, similar to this:
