# Contributions

## We created with wiki on an external source so that it could be updated quickly and easily, by anyone who wishes to do so!

### So how do I do it then?

We've carefully laid out our plans to allow you to add content, upload media, and contribute proofreading so that the wiki can be better than it already is. If you're looking to contribute, check out [Editing the Wiki](editing-the-wiki.md). For the rules and requirements on your additions, go see [Contribution Guidelines](contribution-guidelines.md).
