# X-Link Kai

[X-Link Kai](http://www.teamxlink.co.uk/) is an application that will allow you to use a System-Link (or LAN match) connection over the Internet. Essentially, it connects you to other people in a chat room so their consoles show up under the offline LAN match list. This can only be done in a game which supports LAN matches.

* While there aren't any system limitations for PS2/PS3 games, you may run into game-specific limitations. For example, *Full Spectrum Warrior: Ten Hammers* for PS2 will not work on X-Link Kai, but works fine on on the alternate service XBSlink due to networking oddities.


# Setup

1. Download and install Xlink Kai from the [official website](http://www.teamxlink.co.uk/). You will also need to create an account to play with others.

2. Right-click the Xlink icon and run as administrator.

3. In the bottom right corner of the client, right-click the small Kai icon and select Configure Kai. A browser window will open.

4. Scroll down to Network Settings and change the Port to 30000, Deep Port to 0, and Web UI Port 34522.

5. You will need to forward these ports in your router. You can do this manually by following a guide on [PortForward.com](http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/routerindex.htm) or by using a program to do it. The ports are as follows:

    Type: TCP/UDP


    Start port: 30000


    End port: 30000


    IP Address: (Default) 

    \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

    Type: TCP/UDP


    Start port: 34522

    End port: 34522

    IP Address: (Default) 


    \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

6. Turn on your PS3, browse to Network Settings and configure it all as the default settings (wired or wireless) and restart your PS3.

7. Open Xlink and leave it running. In the top left corner, click the magnifying glass. It will say "No consoles detected".

8. Start up a game that supports LAN play and search for a game. Click the magnifying glass in Xlink again, it should say "PS2/PS3 Configured Successfully".


9. In Xlink, select the globe next to the magnifying glass, then the green arrow next to "PS3". You will need to open the relevant game category, then game, then region for your game. At this point, you can search for a LAN game with your PS3 and you should be able to see all the games that are listed in Xlink (if there are any), or create a match and wait for people to join.

* All tunneling programs like Xlink have low populations and you may not be able to find a game. The more popular the game, the more likely there will be people online. Look into different regions to see if there are games as well; they are especially popular with Latin American countries.
