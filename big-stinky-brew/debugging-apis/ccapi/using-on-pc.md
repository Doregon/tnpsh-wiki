# Using on PC

## Installing CCAPI on your PC

In order for your console and PC to be able to communicate between each other you also need to install the CCAPI software onto your PC. A download for the PC software can be found on the [CCAPI Installer page\]\(](http://store.brewology.com/ahomebrew.php?brewid=254). It requires Windows 7 or later to be installed.

1. Extract the CCAPI\_package\_2.80 folder on your desktop and open the folder named "PC" inside of it. You will find an installer named CCAPI-setup-v2.80.
2. Run the installer, and configure it as you please, or accept default settings.
3. After the install is complete, launch ControlConsole API and ensure that it launches properly.

## Connecting your Console

The final step to setting up the link between your computer and your console is adding your console to Console Manager. This program will save your console's information for you to use at a later time.

1. Launch ControlConsole API on your PC
2. Select the File tab on the top left and "Add new console". A dialog box will appear and ask for you to enter in the console name and IP address.
3. On the XMB navigate to Settings -&gt; Network Settings -&gt; Settings and Connection Status List. Locate where it says IP Address and write it down.
4. Enter a name for your console, and the IP address from Step 3, and press OK to save the settings.
5. You will now see your console's name and IP address listed in the Consoles window. Right click on it and select the Connect option. If it connected to your console, a dialog box will pop up stating that it has successfully connected to your console.
6. Click the Refresh button under the Console info category to verify that it can fetch information from your console.

# Using on Android

## Installing CCAPI on your Android device

An app named [CCAPI Console Manager for PS3](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=enstone.ccapi.consolemanager)  allows you to use an Android device to manage your console. Because it's on the Play Store, you don't have to do any sideloading with the app (unless you're using an Android device that doesn't have the Play Store). It requires Android 4.0 or later to be installed.

## Connecting to your Console

1. Launch the CCAPI app you just installed.
2. Make sure you're on the "Connection" tab (you can check in the sidebar).
3. Put in your PlayStation 3's IP address and connect!

You can now start using [mods](../modding-games.md) and tweaking your console's fans, debug fself and selfs, monitor system thermals, and play around with the LEDs and buzzer on your PS3.
