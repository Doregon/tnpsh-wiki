## PSNpatch

**Connecting to PSN is never 100% safe**

[PSNpatch](http://store.brewology.com/ahomebrew.php?brewid=244) is a multi-functional tool for accessing PSN on CFW. Note that it is not necessary to use PSNinja or SEN Enabler because PSNpatch includes all of the same features. Keep in mind that no tool is 100% effective in preventing bans.

Its features include:

* Offline PSN Game activator
* IDPS + PSID Spoofer
* Firmware Version Spoofer
* Syscall Cleaner \(Hides CFW\)
* Boot Plugin to block PSN until it has been deemed "safe"
* Plugin option to disable CFW, clear history, and spoof IDPS via a button combo
* Option to automatically spoof IDPS at boot \(auto-mode\)

## Tips to avoid getting banned

* Don't run homebrew while connected to PSN; start your game up and use PSNpatch before you connect to PSN.
* **Always** run PSNpatch or similar software to clear your logs and hide your CFW prior to connecting to PSN.
* Use an [antiban EBOOT](https://www.reddit.com/r/ps3homebrew/wiki/antiban) for games that need one
* Modding in public and being reported by other users will get you banned!
