# Installing RAPs and EDATs

PSN content can be activated using PSNpatch. Keep in mind that **this requires that you have connected to PSN or have run reActPSN at least once in the past** in order to active it. [reActPSN](https://www.reddit.com/r/ps3homebrew/wiki/reactpsn) on the other hand, can be used completely offline. You can configure it to search for the RAPs on your internal hard drive if you change the rap file path /dev_hdd0/game/PSNP11001/USRDIR/psnpatch.cfg or /dev_hdd0/game/BLJS10018/USRDIR/default.cfg.

1. Place RAPs and/or EDATs in a folder named "exdata" on your USB storage device. **Ensure that the files end in ".rap" and not ".RAP"**.

2. Plug the USB device into the right-most USB port of your PS3.

3. Launch PSNpatch, and press L1. It should process them, and your content will be activated. You can now remove the flash drive.

* RAPs are installed using the current IDPS (whether it's the original, or spoofed). Your content will only work when using that IDPS.

# Unlocking C00 Demos

Time trial demos, or "C00" demos can be unlocked by pressing R1 from within PSNpatch. The current IDPS does not matter, the demos will stay activated if you change the IDPS.
