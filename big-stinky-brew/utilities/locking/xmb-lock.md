# XMB Lock

**WARNING: The tutorials on this page involve modifying files in the flash. There is a potential for something to go wrong and being unable to start up your PS3 properly. This can be fixed by re-installing your CFW.**

## XMB Lock

[XMB Lock](http://store.brewology.com/ahomebrew.php?brewid=288) is an application to lock down the console settings so that other people, such as children, cannot change them. You can also use the package to enable a reboot button on the XMB. If you are looking for a password or USB authenticated protection, check out [PS3 Lock](https://www.reddit.com/r/ps3homebrew/wiki/ps3_lock).

## Installation

1. Install the package and execute the application.
2. Accept the license agreements.
3. Select Settings Lock, and choose the desired mode.

## Modes

Note that it is recommended to not switch modes often, as each time the mode is switched, it writes to your flash chip and there is a remote chance that something may go wrong.

* Lite Lock: Locks Update, System Settings, and Network Settings.
* Full Lock: Locks all settings in the Settings column.
* Disable Lock: All locks are removed.

## Uninstalling

1. Run the XMB Lock application and select Settings Lock and choose "Disable Lock".
2. Ensure that all settings work properly, and then uninstall the application as normal.
