# XMB Lock

[XMB Lock](http://store.brewology.com/ahomebrew.php?brewid=288) is an application to lock down the console settings so that other people, such as children, cannot change them. You can also use the package to enable a reboot button on the XMB. If you are looking for a password or USB authenticated protection, check out [PS3 Lock](https://www.reddit.com/r/ps3homebrew/wiki/ps3_lock).
