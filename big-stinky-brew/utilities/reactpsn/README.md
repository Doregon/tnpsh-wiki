# reActPSN

reActPSN is a piece of homebrew that lets you do the following tasks:

* (Re)activate PSN games that ask for you to go to the PlayStation Store to play
* Converts PS2 ISOs into PS2 Classics format
* Converts PS3 ISOs into PSN games format (using BDloader)
* Delete user trophies
* Downgrade backups from >4.20 to 4.20 for more compatibility
* Load/unload backups (using BDloader, BDselector)

**Not all of the features available or work right on reActPSN work on HEN.** Testing is being done to see the limits of reActPSN + HEN, so stay up to date to learn more. reActPSN also reports "Unknown CFW!" after launching for the first time on a HEN system, however it will still work.

You also need to have reActPSN v3.20+ to use on HEN. The version on multiMAN's homebrew downloader **does not work at all** and is even **harmful** in some cases.
