# XMB Package Downloader

[XMB Package Downloader](http://store.brewology.com/ahomebrew.php?brewid=295), or XMBPD, is an add-on for Rebug REX that allows you to browse and download categorized homebrew and over 900 themes from the XMB. **Note that this software will most likely software brick any console not running Rebug REX. This can be fixed by re-installing the same firmware**.

# Installing XMBPD
