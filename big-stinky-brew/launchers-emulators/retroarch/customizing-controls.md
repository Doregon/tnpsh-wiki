# Controls

The default controls are different for each core you use. You can open RetroArch's menu while playing a game by pressing both thumbsticks at the same time. You can use save states or change the options for the current core, including the controls under "Input Settings". Key bindings will often show up as "Unknown button" because you are using a controller, which makes it difficult to read and set controls. Be careful when setting controls, you cannot erase a control unless you plug a keyboard in and press Backspace, but you can swap controls around and set unused controller buttons. It's highly recommended to enable the "rewind" feature in supported cores.
