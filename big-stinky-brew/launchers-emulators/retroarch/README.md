# RetroArch

[RetroArch](http://store.brewology.com/ahomebrew.php?brewid=152) is a collection of emulators \(or "cores"\) for the PS3. It can be obtained by their official site [RetroArch.com](http://retroarch.com/index.php?page=platforms). A list of emulators on the PS3 that aren't in RetroArch can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ps3homebrew/wiki/emulators). Newer versions support NetPlay, which allows for multiplayer play over the Internet.

RetroArch can be used in conjunction with [RetroXMB](https://www.reddit.com/r/ps3homebrew/wiki/retroxmb) PKGs for displaying a direct launchable ROM on the XMB.

A video guide to setting up RetroArch can be found on [Modded Warfare's channel](https://youtu.be/1QMYsxnqrGE?list=PLn7ji3VsPy3HtSY6rB8yCCRQpWQOc-uJS).
