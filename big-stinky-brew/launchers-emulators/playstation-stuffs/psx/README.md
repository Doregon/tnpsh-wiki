# PSone

No, I’m not referring to something as something else. I feel that we should acknowledge Sony’s failure product instead of erroneously renaming another console after it.

In this wiki, you’ll find references to PSone rather than PlayStation X. This is because of the improper naming scheme that has been used throughout the homebrew culture’s lifespan.

The failed experiment that’s named PlayStation X was a PS2-DVR combo box only sold in Japan. It was where the XMB originated and could play CDs, DVDs, cable, recordings, and PSone and PS2 games.

This wiki recognizes this product and will not name PSone after PSX. At least the PSone actually caught on, the PSX never stood a chance.
