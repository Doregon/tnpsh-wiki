# No-PSN Apps

Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Video and more apps can be accessed using a special modified pkg that removes the PSN connection requirement. You will need an enabled Internet connection in order for the apps to work properly and avoid errors.

## Using Pre-Made PKGs

1. Uninstall the regular version of the app from your PS3.
2. Download the desired PKGs from [NoPSN.com](http://nopsn.com/pkg/ps3/) or from [here](https://mega.nz/#F!ZHxwSBQA!6Cxdr6bohOXAYhN0IQBgZg) \([release thread](http://www.psx-place.com/threads/collection-of-apps-patched-for-nopsn-access-quick-download-list.14565/)\) or [here](http://www.nextgenupdate.com/forums/ps3-mods-cheats/873234-ps3-nopsn-streaming-multimedia-app-package-collection.html) or [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7cm7o6uh5yafs0e/AABMCQkNzar6WI5xnf9jMdLma?dl=0).
   * If you are physically located in Europe, you will need EU Region Netflix. 
3. Install the PKGs on your PS3, start it, and sign in with your credentials.
4. You can [disable PSN completely](https://www.reddit.com/r/ps3homebrew/wiki/np_environment) to protect yourself from connecting to PSN with any app.
