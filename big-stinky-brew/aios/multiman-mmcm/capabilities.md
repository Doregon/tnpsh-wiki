# Capabilities

## Essentially...

### multiMAN is capable of the following tasks:

* File manager for file operations, such as:
  * Copy and move files between folders/drives
  * Combine split files \(like game backups and split .pkgs\)
  * Extract .zip files
  * Mount "/dev\_blind", a writable version of "/dev\_flash"
  * Creating backups of games
* Update games and packages
* Install multiple package files at once
* Use backups from the network
* Use NTFS drives for games on external disks
* FTP server
* Homebrew downloader
  * often **out of date**, so not recommended
* Movian \(Showtime\) auto-open when opening a media file
* Backup games management

Many people recommend to have multiMAN alongside webMAN... however, **I've had good experience without it altogether**, and using a dedicated file manager in case I need to use a USB. webMAN MOD packs all of the features that multiMAN does, and has native XMB support so you can instantly launch games from your home screen. multiMAN **has also not received any updates** since the days of 4.85, and I have experiences with minor bugs \(most likely isolated issues with just me.\)
