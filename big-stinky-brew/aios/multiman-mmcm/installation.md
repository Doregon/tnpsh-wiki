# Installation

**NOTE:** The old wiki states that the **Brewology site has an UPD and BASE package**. As of this update, there is no UPD pkg and you must use the full BASE.  
**NOTE 2:** Also on the Brewology site, there are two different listings \(one marked BASE and one marked HEN\). **For HEN users**, use the 4.85.01 version, it's already resigned for HEN and the site has the information incorrect.

**To install multiMAN**, follow these steps.

1. **Download latest installer package file** from the official [Brewology](https://store.brewology.com/ahomebrew.php?brewid=24) page.
2. Once that's done, **get a handy USB or fire up your FTP client**.
3. **Copy the file** to your PS3 with FTP/USB \(the /dev\_hdd0/packages folder\).
4. **Install the package.**
5. Run the new **multiMAN**
