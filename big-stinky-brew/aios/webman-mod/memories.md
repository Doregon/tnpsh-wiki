# Capturing Memories

webMAN has built-in facilities to capture screenshots and recordings of your games. 

# Taking Screenshots

By pressing the button combo Start + R2, a screenshot will be saved to `dev_hdd0/photos`. Easy enough.

# Recording Video

Webman allows for video recording while in-game. Press the PS button while in a game, then Select+R3 to begin recording. Press the PS button, and Select+R3 again to stop recording. A MP4 will be generated in /dev_hdd0/VIDEO. Keep in mind that not every game may work.

You also need to make sure that the video recording plugin is loaded before doing this.
