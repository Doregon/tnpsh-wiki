# Installation

**To install webMAN MOD**, follow these steps.

1. **Make sure that you have a CFW that supports Cobra or Mamba!** webMAN is a Cobra or Mamba plugin and requires one of them to function. Rebug, Ferrox, and HFW include Cobra's payload, and can install Mamba as a plugin.
2. **Download latest installer package file** from the official [GitHub releases](https://github.com/aldostools/webMAN-MOD/releases) page.
3. Once that's done, **get a handy USB or fire up your FTP client**.
4. **Copy the file** to your PS3 with FTP/USB \(the /dev\_hdd0/packages folder\).
5. **Install the package.**
6. Scroll down to the new **webMAN** Game entry and **hold L1** as you click on it, to get all of the features.

Once your system reboots, **webMAN should automatically load** \(HEN users will see it load **once you enable HEN**\). Now you can head over to **Customizing** to learn how to make webMAN your own.
