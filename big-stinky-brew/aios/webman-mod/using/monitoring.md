# Monitoring

webMAN contains tools for system monitoring, which prove time and time again to be very helpful when you want to see whatâ€™s going on and whether or not you should take action immediately.

We'll divide this page into sections and expalin each one.

The **red section** is where you'll find your system temperatures. Computer manufacturers commonly measure system temperatures in Celsius rather than Fahrenheit--although both are listed here. In this wiki and the subreddit, we use the Celsius measurement.  Your console should see about 50-60 when the system is idle or 60-70 when it's in or has just come out of a game and in most cases, the RSX will be higher than the CPU. 

* If you're sitting at higher-than-normal temperatures, you should consider following the steps described on the [Cooling Down](../../../../diag-and-maintenance/fix-cooling.md) page.

* For Phat users and 20xx owners: Even if you're sitting at the normal operating range, you should consider keeping your system a little cooler, maybe about 5 degrees. This can help prevent the Yellow Light of Death (YLOD) for *as long as possible*. I say as long due to the fact that cooling isn't the only factor that causes this issue--it's caused by any other major part of your system failing as well. 

* The CPU can handle a maximum of 85 degrees. If you reach too high of a temperature, a notification saying "The system is too hot." will ask for you to shut down your console. webMAN tweaks this notification and says "MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE REACHED!" and promptly raises the fan speed to 100%.
