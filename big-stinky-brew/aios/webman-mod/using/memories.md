# Capturing MemorieswebMAN has built-in facilities to capture screenshots and recordings of your games. # Taking ScreenshotsBy pressing the button combo Start + R2, a screenshot will be saved to `dev_hdd0/photos`. Easy enough. Should this not work for you, there is another option. You can set the custom [pad shortcut](../customizing/pad-shortcuts.md) to the screenshot URL and it will work with R2 + Square.# Recording VideoWebman allows for video recording while in-game. Press the PS button while in a game, then Select+R3 to begin recording. Press the PS button, and Select+R3 again to stop recording. A MP4 will be generated in /dev_hdd0/VIDEO. Keep in mind that not every game may work.You also need to make sure that the video recording plugin is loaded before doing this.
