# External Devices

Have a external drive or a server that you want to dump some backups onto? webMAN supports running games from places other than the internal hard drive. 

# Running Backups over Network
[PS3netsrv](https://www.reddit.com/r/ps3homebrew/wiki/ps3netsrv) is a function that allows you to stream game backups over your network from a PC. You can configure this option in Webman Games → Webman Setup → PS3 Webman [Setup], by entering the IP address of your PS3netsrv server host and the port under the "Scan for LAN games/videos" setting. The games will then show up with the rest of your games in the Webman games folder on the XMB.

# Installing PKGs to an External

Webman gives you the option to redirect the install location of PKGs to your external hard drive. You can toggle this between a USB device and your internal hard drive by selecting Webman Games → Webman Setup → Toggle external gameDATA. After toggling it, you can back out to the XMB and install a package as usual. A folder will be created on your USB device labelled "GAMEI" and will host your installed files. Not all games are compatible with an externalized gameDATA.
