# Troubleshooting

webMAN isn’t free of problems, but you can overcome them by using the solutions below or finding your own way!

* Games won't show up in games list
 * Try selecting Webman Games → Webman Setup → Refresh XML and then reboot. If you are using an NTFS hard drive, update to the latest version of Webman by looking at the installation instructions above.

* Webman crashes to recovery
 * Try deleting the old Webman settings by navigating into Webman Games → Webman Setup → Delete Config. Alternatively, you can use the button combo SELECT+L2+R2+R3.

* Games won't load after updating
 * Make sure that your CFW has Cobra integrated in it. If you are on Rebug 4.81.2 or older, make sure that Cobra is turned on in Rebug Toolbox. Occasionally when updating, you will still see Webman on the XMB even though Cobra is turned off.

* PS3 Freezing when trying to launch a Webman game
 * Try toggling Cobra off and back on in Rebug Toolbox.
