# Firmware Update 4.87

## Recently, Sony released OFW 4.87. This update caused panic, but we're here to detail what's up.

On December 3, 2020, Sony released update 4.87, with new Blu-ray licensing keys and some security fixes. However, this wasn't enough to stop the homebrew community from releasing new firmwares and software to combat the **mandatory update**, requiring all users to be on this update to use PlayStation Network.

### The guide written in this section was made by u/AzgalorFelore, credit to them for the good work! Information on installing HEN 4.87.1 HFW can be found in the PS3HEN section of this Wiki.

**NOTE: These guides target the HEN users of the homebrew community. CFW users can use SEN enabler to bypass this update.**
